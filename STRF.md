STRF
strf is the satellite tracking toolkit for radio observations (RF). The software is designed to allow tracking of satellites from radio observations, using Doppler curves to identify satellites and/or determine their orbits.

The software is designed for linux operating systems, and will work with most software defined radios (SDRs), certainly those that are supported by http://www.gnuradio.org. The software comes with tools for data acquisition, performing FFTs to generate timestamped spectrograms (waterfall plots), and analysis, to extract and analyse Doppler curves.

Gemini:
    Okay, I can help convert the C code from the strf-main folder to Python. This project appears to be a toolkit for satellite tracking using RF observations, involving complex calculations like orbit propagation (SGP4/SDP4), FFTs, Doppler calculation, and data fitting/plotting.

Translating a large C project with external dependencies (like pgplot, fftw3, gsl, sox) directly to Python is a significant undertaking. A line-by-line translation might not be the most efficient or "Pythonic" approach. Often, it's better to leverage existing Python libraries that provide similar functionality.

Here's a general strategy:

Identify Core Functionality: Break down the C code into its main components (e.g., TLE parsing, orbit propagation, FFT, data I/O, plotting, fitting).
Find Python Equivalents: Search for established Python libraries that handle these tasks (e.g., sgp4 for orbit propagation, numpy/scipy.fft or pyfftw for FFTs, matplotlib/plotly for plotting, scipy.optimize for fitting, astropy for time/coordinate handling, numpy for array operations).
Translate Logic: Convert the core algorithms and data handling logic from C to Python, using the identified libraries.
Refactor: Adapt the structure to Python conventions (using classes, standard library features, etc.).
Due to the complexity, I'll provide translations for key parts of the codebase incrementally. Let's start with some utility functions found in satutl.c, as they handle fundamental tasks like TLE parsing and string manipulation.

satutl.c -> satutl.py
Explanation and Notes:

Alpha5 Conversion: The alpha5_to_number and number_to_alpha5 functions directly translate the logic from satutl.c. They handle the specific character mapping used in TLEs.
String Utilities: strip_leading_spaces and strip_trailing_spaces are replaced by Python's built-in .lstrip() and .rstrip() string methods. zero_pad uses f-strings for formatting.
read_twoline -> load_tle_from_file:
Reading TLEs line-by-line and parsing them manually is complex and error-prone. The Python sgp4 library is the standard way to handle this.
The provided load_tle_from_file function demonstrates how to read a TLE file, handle potential name lines (including stripping the leading 0 as seen in the C code), identify line pairs, and use Satrec.twoline2rv from the sgp4 library to parse them into satellite objects.
It includes error handling for file not found and parsing errors.
It supports searching for a specific satno or loading all TLEs.
The C code's static variables and file pointer handling are replaced by reading the whole file or iterating through it within the function scope.
Dependencies: This Python code assumes you have the sgp4 library installed (pip install sgp4).
Error Handling: The C code uses a custom fatal_error. The Python version uses standard exceptions (ValueError, FileNotFoundError, Exception) and prints messages to stderr or raises exceptions as appropriate.
Vector Allocation: The C code's vector function (for zero-initialized memory allocation) is not directly needed in Python, as Python lists and library structures (like NumPy arrays) handle memory management automatically.
This Python module satutl.py provides some of the basic utility functions. Next, we could look at translating rftime.c (time conversions) or rfio.c (spectrogram I/O). Which part would you like to translate next?

Okay, let's continue by translating rftime.c, which handles time conversions, particularly involving Modified Julian Date (MJD).

In Python, we can achieve this using the built-in datetime module and potentially the astropy library (which is already listed as a dependency in contrib/requirements.txt and used in contrib/analyze_artifact.py and contrib/satnogs_waterfall_tabulation_helper.py) for robust handling of astronomical time scales like MJD.

rftime.c -> rftime.py
Explanation and Notes:

Astropy Preference: The code checks if astropy is available. If it is, it uses astropy.time.Time for MJD conversions, which is generally more accurate and handles different time scales correctly. If astropy is not found, it falls back to a basic implementation derived from the C code's logic.
nfd_to_mjd: Uses datetime.fromisoformat for robust parsing of the timestamp string. It ensures the datetime object is UTC before conversion.
date_to_mjd: Directly implements the algorithm from the C code for converting year, month, and (potentially fractional) day to MJD.
mjd_to_nfd: Converts MJD back to the 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.fff' string format.
DOY/Year Conversions: The mjd_to_doy and doy_to_mjd functions were added based on logic seen in rffit.c that likely relies on the mjd2date function (implicitly defined via _mjd_to_date_components). These are included for completeness if that functionality is needed elsewhere.
Timezones: The Python code explicitly handles timezones (assuming UTC if none is provided in the NFD string), which is crucial for correct time conversions. The C code's handling of timezones isn't explicitly shown in rftime.c but is important in practice.
Precision: The astropy version will generally offer higher precision. The basic implementation uses standard Python floats. The NFD output format is truncated to milliseconds ([:-3]) to match the apparent precision in the C code's examples.
Next, we could translate rfio.c (handling the spectrogram .bin files) or rfsites.c (handling site information). Which would you prefer?

Okay, let's proceed with translating rfio.c, which handles reading and writing the custom spectrogram .bin files.

We'll use Python's built-in file handling, the re module for parsing the text header, and numpy for efficient handling of the numerical data. We'll also include a placeholder for the zscale function, assuming it would be available from a separate zscale.py module (translated from zscale.c).

rfio.c -> rfio.py
Explanation and Notes:

Spectrogram Class: A simple Spectrogram class is used to hold the data and metadata, similar to the C struct.
Header Parsing: _parse_header uses regular expressions (re) to find and extract values from the 256-byte header string. This is more robust than sscanf to variations or missing fields. It handles decoding and potential errors.
Data Reading:
It first reads the header of the starting file (isub) to determine parameters.
It calculates the channel range (j0, j1) if frequency zooming (f0, df0) is requested.
It determines the total number of subintegrations to read (nsub_total_expected) and allocates numpy arrays accordingly.
It iterates through the files (_000000.bin, _000001.bin, etc.) starting from isub.
Inside each file, it reads headers and data chunks sequentially.
It handles both float32 (NBITS=-32) and int8 (NBITS=8) data types, applying scaling for int8 based on the MEAN/RMS values from the header.
It accumulates data into the numpy array (s.z), performing binning (nbin) as specified. MJD and length are also averaged/summed per bin.
Error handling is included for missing files, incomplete reads, and memory allocation failures.
Numpy: numpy is used for efficient storage and computation on the numerical data (s.z, s.mjd, s.length, s.zavg, s.zstd). Array slicing (raw_data[j0:j1]) is used for frequency zooming.
Binning: The logic accumulates nbin subintegrations into each output slot before averaging and moving to the next. It handles partially filled bins at the end.
Z-Scaling: It includes a placeholder call to a zscale_samples function (assuming translation from zscale.c). If zscale isn't available, it falls back to using percentiles for robust min/max scaling.
Writing: write_spectrogram provides a simplified way to write the entire processed Spectrogram object back to a single .bin file. It recreates the header for each subintegration before writing its float32 data slice. Note that the C version might implicitly handle writing back to multiple files if NSUB was different, and it could write int8 if specified. This Python version simplifies this for demonstration.
Dependencies: Requires numpy. Assumes rftime.py (from the previous step) is available. The zscale functionality depends on translating zscale.c.
This module provides the core I/O for the spectrogram files. Next logical steps could be translating zscale.c, rfsites.c, or starting on the processing/plotting modules like rffft.c or rfplot.c. What would you like to translate next?

Okay, let's translate the zscale.c file. This module implements the ZScale algorithm, commonly used in astronomy (e.g., by IRAF/DS9) to determine robust minimum and maximum intensity values for displaying an image or spectrogram, enhancing contrast without being overly sensitive to outliers.

We'll use numpy for array operations and calculations. This translation assumes the Spectrogram class from the previous rfio.py translation is available or that the input image_data is a 2D NumPy array.

zscale.c -> zscale.py
Explanation and Notes:

Dependencies: Requires numpy (pip install numpy).
Main Function (zscale_samples):
Takes a 2D NumPy array image_data as input.
Handles sampling (np.random.choice), sorting (samples.sort()), and basic stats (np.median).
Calls _zsc_fit_line to get the slope and intercept of the pixel distribution.
Calculates z1 and z2 based on the median, slope, and contrast, ensuring they remain within the actual data min/max. The calculation logic closely follows the C implementation lines 118-119.
Includes fallbacks if the input data is invalid or the fit fails.
Line Fitting (_zsc_fit_line):
Translates the iterative rejection logic from zsc_fit_line in the C code.
Uses np.polyfit for linear regression on the non-rejected pixels.
Calls _zsc_compute_sigma to calculate the standard deviation of the residuals.
Rejects pixels based on the krej * sigma threshold.
Implements the pixel rejection growing logic (convolution in C) using basic NumPy array manipulation to mark neighbors of rejected pixels.
Returns the number of good pixels and the final fitted start value (zstart) and slope (zslope, scaled per pixel index).
Sigma Calculation (_zsc_compute_sigma):
Calculates the mean and standard deviation of a subset of samples, excluding masked ones, matching the C implementation. Uses ddof=1 for sample standard deviation.
Spectrogram Input: The original C code takes a struct spectrogram*. This Python version takes a numpy.ndarray. If you use the Spectrogram class from rfio.py, you would pass s.z to this function: z1, z2 = zscale_samples(spectrogram_obj.z).
Sampling: The C code zsc_sample uses a stride line 30. This Python version uses random sampling (np.random.choice) on the flattened array of finite pixels, which is simpler and often statistically sufficient for large images.
Robustness: Using np.median and filtering np.nan/np.inf adds robustness compared to potential issues in the C code if not handled carefully.
This zscale.py module can now be imported and used by rfio.py or other plotting scripts to determine display ranges.

What component should we translate next? We could look at rfsites.c (site data handling), rftles.c (TLE list handling), or start tackling one of the main processing/analysis modules like rffft.c or rffit.c.

Okay, let's continue by translating rfsites.c. This file contains the logic for reading observing site information from the sites.txt file.

We will replicate the logic using standard Python file handling and string parsing. The function will locate the sites.txt file based on environment variables, similar to the C version, or allow specifying a path.

rfsites.c -> rfsites.py
Explanation and Notes:

Site Class: A simple Site class is introduced to hold the site data in a structured way, similar to the C struct site.
File Path: The get_site_filepath helper function replicates the logic of finding sites.txt using the ST_SITES_TXT and ST_DATADIR environment variables.
Parsing: The get_site function reads the specified file line by line. It uses a regular expression (re.match) to parse each line, which is generally more flexible than C's sscanf for handling variations in spacing or observer names.
Error Handling:
It handles FileNotFoundError if the sites.txt path is invalid.
It uses warnings.warn for non-critical parsing issues on specific lines.
If the site_id is not found, it raises a ValueError to mimic the C code's exit(-1) behavior. Returning None is another common Python pattern if you prefer not to raise an exception.
It warns if a site ID is found multiple times, matching the C code's behavior.
Altitude: The altitude read from the file (assumed to be in meters) is converted to kilometers before storing in the Site object, as done in the C code.
This rfsites.py module provides the necessary function to load site coordinates, which will be needed by modules performing calculations relative to an observer's location (like rffit.c, rftrace.c).

What's the next C file you'd like to convert? We could look at rftles.c or start on one of the main processing files like rffft.c.

Okay, let's proceed with translating rftles.c. This module is responsible for loading TLE (Two-Line Element) data from a file and providing access to individual TLEs.

We will use the sgp4 Python library, which excels at parsing TLE files and creating satellite objects (Satrec). This approach replaces the manual parsing and structure management seen in the C code (read_twoline from satutl.c and the tle_array_t struct).

rftles.c -> rftles.py
Explanation and Notes:

sgp4 Library: This translation heavily relies on the sgp4 Python library. It handles the complexities of parsing TLE lines (including checksums, epoch formats, element conversions) and creates Satrec objects suitable for orbit propagation. You need to install it: pip install sgp4.
TleData Class: A simple container class holds the loaded TLEs. It uses both a dictionary (satellites) for fast lookup by NORAD ID (satnum) and a list (sat_list) to maintain the original order and allow access by index.
load_tles Function:
Determines the file path using the same environment variable logic as the C code (ST_TLEDIR, default bulk.tle).
Reads the file line by line.
It attempts to identify name lines (lines not starting with '1 ' or '2 ') preceding a valid TLE pair. It also handles the case where 0 might prefix a name line.
It uses sgp4.io.twoline2rv_ordered to parse the TLE lines into a Satrec object. Using _ordered ensures the resulting Satrec object maintains the exact epoch details from the TLE, which is important for consistency.
Stores the Satrec object along with the parsed name (or a default name) and the original lines in the TleData object.
Includes error handling for file I/O and TLE parsing errors, issuing warnings for skipped lines.
Access Functions:
get_tle_by_index: Returns the satellite information dictionary from the sat_list based on the load order index.
get_tle_by_catalog_id: Returns the satellite information dictionary from the satellites dictionary using the NORAD ID (satnum) as the key.
Alpha-5: The alpha5_to_number and number_to_alpha5 functions (from satutl.py) might be needed if the code elsewhere specifically requires interacting with the Alpha-5 format shown in the TLE lines, but the sgp4 library typically uses the standard integer NORAD ID (satnum).
Memory: The free_tles C function is unnecessary in Python due to automatic garbage collection.
This rftles.py module provides a Pythonic way to load and access TLE data, leveraging the sgp4 library for the heavy lifting of parsing.

We are making good progress through the utility modules. Shall we translate rffft_internal.c (filename parsing) next, or move to a more complex processing module like rffft.c or rffit.c?

Okay, let's continue with the translation. The next module we'll translate is rffft_internal.c. This file contains the function rffft_params_from_filename, which is responsible for parsing various SDR filename conventions (SatDump, GQRX, SDR Console) to extract metadata like timestamp, frequency, sample rate, and data format.

We'll use Python's re module for robust pattern matching instead of trying to replicate sscanf.

rffft_internal.c -> rffft_internal.py
Explanation and Notes:

Regular Expressions: Uses re.compile to define patterns for each filename format. This is more readable and maintainable than complex sscanf chains.
Multiple Patterns: It tries patterns sequentially until a match is found. The order matters, especially for the SatDump formats where variations exist.
Group Extraction: match.groups() extracts the captured parts (parentheses in the regex). These are then converted to the appropriate types (int, float).
Format Mapping: A dictionary FORMAT_MAP translates the file extension or indicator (like _fc for GQRX) into the single character format code ('c', 'i', 'f', 'w') expected by the rffft processing logic.
Timestamp Formatting: The extracted date/time components are formatted into the standard ISO 8601-like string (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.fff) used elsewhere in the code (like rftime.py).
SDR Console: Handles the specific date format (DD-Mon-YYYY) and frequency unit (MHz). Note that the sample rate for SDR Console WAV files is set to 0.0 here, as it needs to be read from the WAV file header itself (matching the C code's apparent logic, although the C code doesn't explicitly show how it gets the sample rate later for .wav).
Error Handling: Returns None if no pattern matches the filename and prints a warning. It also includes warnings for specific parsing issues like unrecognized months.
This rffft_internal.py module provides the necessary filename parsing capability for the main rffft script.

We've covered most of the core utility modules. Shall we now tackle one of the main application scripts like rffft.c (which performs the FFT processing) or rffit.c (which performs orbit fitting)? These will be more complex as they integrate multiple functionalities and external libraries.

Okay, let's tackle the translation of rffft.c. This is the core script responsible for reading I/Q data, performing FFTs, integrating the results, and writing the output spectrogram .bin files.

This Python version will use numpy for numerical operations and FFTs, soundfile for reading WAV files (as a replacement for libsox), and argparse for command-line argument handling. It will also utilize the previously translated rftime.py and rffft_internal.py modules.

rffft.c -> rffft.py
Explanation and Notes:

Dependencies: Requires numpy and optionally soundfile (pip install numpy soundfile). Assumes rftime.py and rffft_internal.py are available.
Argument Parsing: Uses argparse for cleaner command-line argument handling.
Filename Parsing (-P): Integrates the rffft_params_from_filename function from rffft_internal.py.
WAV Input (-F w): Uses the soundfile library to read WAV files. It checks for 2 channels (I/Q) and reads the sample rate from the header if not provided/parsed.
FFT Implementation:
Uses numpy.fft.fft for the Fast Fourier Transform.
Applies a Hamming window (numpy.hamming) before the FFT, similar to the C code's zw array.
Calculates power (abs(fft_result)**2).
Uses numpy.fft.fftshift to center the spectrum.
Data Types: Reads binary data using numpy.frombuffer with the specified data type (np.int8, np.int16, np.float32). WAV reading uses soundfile which typically returns floats. Accumulation is done in float64 for precision, final output is float32 or int8.
Integration/Binning: Accumulates nint power spectra (power_spectrum_acc) before averaging and writing. The -m/nuse option is implemented by skipping FFTs.
Output:
Writes output files sequentially (_000000.bin, _000001.bin, etc.).
Constructs the 256-byte header in Python, including timestamp, frequency, bandwidth, etc., similar to rfio.c. It correctly handles the adjusted parameters when partial frequency output (-R) is used.
Supports byte output (-b) by scaling the float spectrum to int8 based on its mean and standard deviation, mirroring the C code's approach.
Writes data using ndarray.tobytes().
Partial Frequency Output (-R): Calculates the channel indices corresponding to the requested frequency range and extracts only that portion after the fftshift. The header values (FREQ, BW, NCHAN) are adjusted accordingly for the output file.
Signal Squaring (-2, -4): Implements the signal squaring logic before the FFT for BPSK/QPSK detection.
Frequency Inversion (-I): Achieved by multiplying the imaginary part by -1 before the FFT, equivalent to complex conjugation.
Realtime vs. File Time: If -T or -P is used, it calculates timestamps based on the start time and sample rate. Otherwise (realtime mode), it uses the current system time (datetime.now(timezone.utc)).
Error Handling: Includes basic error handling for file I/O, invalid arguments, and end-of-file conditions. Uses try...except...finally for cleanup.
Quiet Mode (-q): Suppresses progress messages.
This rffft.py script forms the core of the spectrogram generation process. The next logical step would likely be translating one of the analysis or plotting scripts like rfplot.c or rffit.c. Which one should we focus on?

Okay, let's tackle the translation of rffit.c. This is a more complex script that involves reading Doppler data, loading TLEs, fitting orbital parameters to the data using an optimization routine (Downhill Simplex, implemented via versafit, dsmin, simplex), and interactively plotting the results using pgplot.

The Python translation will involve several libraries:

numpy for numerical calculations.
scipy.optimize for the fitting process (replacing versafit/dsmin/simplex).
sgp4 for TLE parsing and orbit propagation.
matplotlib for plotting (replacing pgplot).
Previously translated modules: rftime.py, rfsites.py, rftles.py.
Replicating the exact interactive plotting behavior of pgplot's pgband within matplotlib requires significant GUI programming. Therefore, this translation will focus on:

Reading the Doppler data.
Setting up the orbit propagation using sgp4.
Defining the velocity calculation and chi-squared objective function.
Setting up the parameter fitting using scipy.optimize.minimize.
Providing a basic static plot of the data and the fitted curve using matplotlib.
Full interactivity would require a more involved GUI application structure.

rffit.c -> rffit.py (Core Logic & Basic Plotting)
Explanation and Major Changes:

Dependencies: Requires numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and sgp4.
Structure: Uses simple classes DopplerPoint and FitData to organize data, replacing C structs. A global FitData object (global_fit_data) is used to pass data to the chi_squared_doppler function, mimicking the C approach for simplicity in this translation (a more Pythonic way would use classes or closures).
Data Loading: read_doppler_data reads the text file, parses lines (more robustly than sscanf), converts frequency to kHz, applies the offset, calculates reference MJD/frequency, and pre-calculates relative offsets. It also caches Site objects.
Velocity/Coordinates:
observer_position_velocity_ecef calculates the observer's ECEF position/velocity using standard formulas and WGS72 constants (matching SGP4).
calculate_doppler_velocity uses satrec.sgp4 to get satellite TEME position/velocity. Crucially, it notes the frame inconsistency between TEME and ECEF. For simplicity matching the C code's apparent direct calculation, it proceeds but acknowledges this limitation. A rigorous solution requires TEME<->ECEF transformations (astropy.coordinates is ideal for this). It also calculates Azimuth/Altitude based on the C code's method (mixed frame RA/Dec -> Topocentric).
Fitting:
chi_squared_doppler: This is the objective function. It takes the current parameter guess, updates a copy of the Satrec object (or modifies the global one here for simplicity), propagates the orbit for each data point, calculates the model Doppler frequency (handling bistatic GRAVES case), finds the residual vs the observed frequency, and returns the sum of squares.
fit_orbit: Sets up the fit. It extracts the initial parameters from the loaded Satrec, defines which parameters are active (active_mask), sets up scipy.optimize.minimize using the 'Nelder-Mead' method (equivalent to Downhill Simplex), and calls the optimizer. After fitting, it updates the Satrec object and ffit with the results.
Plotting: plot_data_and_fit provides a static plot using matplotlib. It shows data points, ignored points (flag=0), and the fitted model curve (if a TLE is loaded). The complex interactive selection/modification features from the C code's pgplot loop are not implemented here.
Main Block: Parses arguments, loads data, loads the initial TLE (if specified), configures which parameters to fit (currently set to fit all enabled ones), runs the fit, and displays the static plot.
Removed Interactivity: The extensive interactive loop (pgband, key presses for toggling parameters, selection, manual editing) from rffit.c is omitted. Implementing this requires a GUI framework (like Matplotlib's native backends, PyQt, Tkinter, etc.) and is beyond a straightforward translation.
This script provides the core fitting functionality. You can run it with data and a TLE to get a fit and a plot. Adding the interactivity would be the next major development step for this module.

Okay, let's continue the translation process. Since rfplot.c depends heavily on calculating satellite traces, it makes sense to translate rftrace.c first. This module computes predicted Doppler frequency traces for satellites based on their TLEs and an observer's location.

This Python translation will use the sgp4 library for orbit propagation and rely on the previously translated modules rftime.py, rfsites.py, and rftles.py, along with numpy. We'll also incorporate the calculate_doppler_velocity logic developed during the rffit.py translation.

rftrace.c -> rftrace.py
Explanation and Notes:

Dependencies: Requires numpy, sgp4, and the previously translated rftime, rfsites, rftles, rffit (specifically for the coordinate/velocity functions).
Trace Class: A Trace class holds the computed data for a single satellite (MJD times, predicted Doppler frequencies, zenith angles).
read_frequency_list: Reads the satellite frequency catalog file (e.g., frequencies.txt).
is_classified: Checks if a satellite is listed in classfd.tle, mimicking the C function.
compute_trace:
This is the main function replacing the C version.
It filters satellites from the frequency list based on whether their rest frequency could possibly Doppler shift into the observed band (center_freq_hz +/- bandwidth_hz / 2 +/- max Doppler shift).
It iterates through relevant TLEs.
For each satellite, it propagates the orbit for each mjd_time.
It uses calculate_doppler_velocity (from rffit.py translation, potentially move to a common util module) to get line-of-sight velocity and altitude.
It calculates the Doppler-shifted frequency (trace.freq) based on the rest frequency (freq0_hz) and the velocity.
It handles the bistatic calculation for GRAVES mode (graves=True).
It calculates and stores the Zenith Angle (trace.za).
It only returns traces for satellites that are calculated to be above the horizon (visible_points > 0) at some point during the time span.
compute_doppler:
This function replicates the functionality of rfdop.c.
It takes a specific satno and computes detailed information (range, velocity, az/alt) for the observer and potentially the GRAVES site over the specified mjd_times.
It saves the results to a text file (output_filename).
Includes the -H option logic (skip_high_orbits).
Coordinate Frames: As noted in the rffit.py translation, the calculation of relative velocity and az/alt involves potentially inconsistent coordinate frames (TEME from SGP4, ECEF for observer). This translation mimics the C code's apparent direct calculations, but a fully rigorous implementation should use coordinate transformations (e.g., via astropy.coordinates).
identify_trace: This functionality (comparing an observed trace to predictions) is not included in this translation as it requires defining the input format for the observed trace and implementing the comparison logic (interpolation, RMS).
This rftrace.py module allows calculating the predicted paths of satellites through frequency-time space, which is essential for overlaying onto spectrograms (rfplot) and potentially for identification (rffit).

We have now translated most of the core data handling, utility, and calculation modules. The remaining major pieces are the interactive plotting/analysis applications (rfplot.c, rffit.c's interactive part) and the specific signal processing scripts (rffind.c, rfedit.c). Shall we attempt to translate rfplot.c next, focusing on the static plotting aspects?

Okay, let's translate rfplot.c. This script is the main tool for visualizing the spectrogram .bin files, overlaying satellite traces, and potentially performing interactive analysis like selecting points and fitting traces.

As mentioned before, replicating the full interactive PGPLOT interface (pgband loop with many keyboard shortcuts) in Python with Matplotlib is complex and usually requires building a more dedicated GUI application. This translation will focus on the core functionality: loading data, calculating traces, generating the plot with overlays, and translating the non-interactive helper functions like filter and peakfind. Basic Matplotlib interactivity (zoom, pan) will be available by default.

Dependencies: numpy, matplotlib, and the previously translated modules rfio.py, rftime.py, rftrace.py, zscale.py, rftles.py, rfsites.py. Potentially scipy.optimize if fitting logic is included.

rfplot.c -> rfplot.py
Explanation and Notes:

Dependencies: Requires numpy, matplotlib, and the previously translated Python modules (rfio, rftime, rftrace, zscale, rftles, rfsites).
Argument Parsing: Uses argparse to handle command-line options, similar to the C version.
Data Loading: Uses rfio.read_spectrogram to load the data based on path prefix and parameters.
Trace Calculation: Uses rftles.load_tles and rftrace.compute_trace to get the predicted satellite traces.
Plotting:
Uses matplotlib.pyplot.imshow to display the spectrogram data (spectrogram.z).
Sets aspect='auto' for automatic aspect ratio adjustment.
Sets origin='lower' so frequency increases upwards.
Uses the extent argument to map pixel indices to time (subintegration index) and absolute frequency (MHz).
Uses zscale.zscale_samples results (spectrogram.zmin, spectrogram.zmax) for vmin and vmax. An option -z allows overriding zmax similar to the C code (interpreted as a multiplier here).
Axes Formatting: Implements custom matplotlib.ticker.FuncFormatter functions (time_axis_formatter, freq_axis_formatter) to mimic the specialized time and frequency offset axes from the C version's time_axis and relative frequency logic.
Trace Overlay: The plot_traces function iterates through the computed traces, masks points below the horizon (using the Zenith Angle za from the Trace object), and plots the visible segments using ax.plot. It adds text labels for the satellites. The --show-names flag toggles between showing just the number or number and name.
Interactivity: This version produces a static plot. The complex interactive loop (pgband, keyboard shortcuts for fitting, selection, identification, etc.) is omitted. Users can use Matplotlib's built-in interactive tools for basic zoom/pan. Implementing the custom interactions would require significant additional code using Matplotlib's event system.
Filtering/Peakfinding: The filter_data function (translating filter from rfplot.c/rffind.c) performs sigma clipping and local maxima finding, saving results to filter.dat if the --filter flag is used. The peakfind C function involving convolution and parabolic fits is not translated in this version but could be added using numpy.convolve and numpy.polyfit.
Fitting: Calls related to fitting (fit_trace, fit_gaussian_trace, identify_trace) are commented out or depend on those functions being available (e.g., imported from rffit.py or rftrace.py if translated).
This rfplot.py provides the core visualization capabilities. To fully replicate the original, the next steps would involve:

Translating the peakfind algorithm.
Translating/Integrating the fitting (fit_trace, fit_gaussian_trace) and identification (identify_trace) logic.
Building the complex interactive event handling loop using Matplotlib callbacks.
What part would you like to focus on next? We could translate rffind.c (which seems to contain another version of the filtering/peak finding logic) or rfedit.c.

Okay, let's translate rffind.c. This script is a command-line tool designed to read spectrogram data, find peaks above a certain sigma threshold using a filtering algorithm, and write the detected peaks (MJD, frequency, significance, site ID) to an output file.

It essentially extracts the filter functionality seen within rfplot.c (and translated in rfplot.py) into a standalone script.

rffind.c -> rffind.py
Explanation and Notes:

Dependencies: Requires numpy and the previously translated rfio.py and rftime.py.
Core Logic: The main work is done in find_peaks_in_spectrogram, which translates the filter function from rffind.c and rfplot.c.
Sigma Clipping: It performs iterative sigma clipping (up to 10 times or until convergence) to establish a robust baseline (mean, std dev) for each time slice (subintegration) of the spectrogram. It handles potential NaN values during calculations.
Peak Detection: It identifies points in the original data that exceed the calculated baseline by sigma_thresh * std_dev.
Local Maxima: It applies a filter to keep only those peaks that are local maxima compared to their immediate neighbors, if those neighbors are also above the threshold. This prevents identifying multiple points for a single, slightly spread-out peak.
Output: Appends detected peaks (MJD, Frequency in Hz, Sigma value, Site ID) to the specified output file. The GRAVES mode adds the remote site ID (9999). File is opened in append mode ('a').
File Reading:
The main function handles argument parsing.
It uses rfio.read_spectrogram to load the data.
It correctly handles the case where -l 0 is specified (meaning process all available files sequentially) by calling read_spectrogram in a loop for increasing file indices until no more data is found.
If a specific length (-l) is given, it reads that many subintegrations starting from the -s index.
No Binning/Offset: Unlike rfplot, rffind.c doesn't seem to have options for binning (-b) or frequency offset (-o), so those arguments are not included here. It processes the data at its native time resolution.
This script provides the command-line peak finding capability. The remaining C files are primarily the SGDP4/Deep space C implementation (sgdp4.c, deep.c) which we've decided to replace with the sgp4 Python library, the optimization routines (versafit.c, dsmin.c, simplex.c) replaced by scipy.optimize, the simple rfinfo.c and rfedit.c, and the test files.

Would you like to translate rfinfo.c (which prints basic info from a .bin file header) or rfedit.c (its purpose seems less clear from the code, possibly applying edits based on frequency range/offset)? Or perhaps focus on integrating the fitting/identification logic into rffit.py or rfplot.py?

Okay, let's review the status of the C to Python translation for the strf-main project.

Modules Translated or Addressed (Python Equivalents Provided):

satutl.c / .h -> satutl.py: Core utilities, Alpha-5 conversion, basic TLE string handling.
rftime.c / .h -> rftime.py: Time conversions (MJD, NFD, DOY).
rfio.c / .h -> rfio.py: Reading and writing spectrogram .bin files, including header parsing and data handling with NumPy.
zscale.c / .h -> zscale.py: ZScale algorithm for image/spectrogram display scaling.
rfsites.c / .h -> rfsites.py: Reading site information from sites.txt.
rffft_internal.c / .h -> rffft_internal.py: Parsing SDR filenames (SatDump, GQRX, SDR Console) to extract metadata.
rftles.c / .h -> rftles.py: Loading TLE files and accessing TLE data using the sgp4 library.
rftrace.c / .h -> rftrace.py: Computing predicted satellite Doppler traces.
rffft.c -> rffft.py: Core FFT processing script (reading IQ, FFT, integration, writing .bin files).
rffind.c -> rffind.py: Standalone script for finding peaks in spectrograms.
rffit.c -> rffit.py (Partial): Core logic for Doppler data loading, velocity calculation, chi-squared function, and setting up the fit with scipy.optimize has been translated. The interactive plotting/selection part was omitted due to complexity.
Modules Replaced by Python Libraries:

sgdp4.c, sgdp4h.h, deep.c: SGP4/SDP4 orbit propagation logic -> Replaced by the sgp4 Python library.
versafit.c, dsmin.c, simplex.c: Downhill Simplex optimization -> Replaced by scipy.optimize.minimize (using the 'Nelder-Mead' method).
ferror.c: Basic error handling -> Replaced by standard Python exception handling.
Plotting Library Replacement:

All plotting previously done with pgplot (rfplot.c, rffit.c, rfpng.c) is planned to be replaced by matplotlib.
Remaining C Files Not Yet Translated:

rfedit.c: This script seems to read a spectrogram (read_spectrogram), potentially modify it (though the modification logic isn't immediately obvious without deeper analysis - it has options for offset, freq, bw), and then write it back out (write_spectrogram). Its exact purpose beyond simple frequency/offset adjustments applied via read_spectrogram might need clarification.
rfinfo.c: A very simple utility that reads the header of the first .bin file in a sequence and prints basic information (frequency, bandwidth, channels, number of files found). This would be straightforward to translate.
rfpng.c: Creates a PNG plot of a spectrogram, likely using pgplot. Its functionality largely overlaps with the static plotting part of rfplot.py that uses matplotlib. Translating this might be redundant unless specific non-interactive plotting features are needed.
rfdop.c: A command-line tool to compute detailed Doppler information (range, velocity, az/alt) for a specific satellite over a time range and save it to a file. The core calculation logic is now part of rftrace.py (compute_doppler function). Translating the command-line wrapper itself would be simple.
tests/*.c, tests/*.h: Code for running unit tests. These are usually not directly translated; equivalent tests would be written using Python testing frameworks like unittest or pytest.
In summary: We've translated the bulk of the core data handling, utilities, processing (FFT), trace calculation, fitting setup, and peak finding code. The main remaining tasks involve the simpler utilities (rfinfo, rfedit, rfdop wrapper, potentially rfpng), and significantly, implementing the full interactive capabilities originally provided by pgplot in rfplot.c and rffit.c using a Python plotting/GUI framework.

What would you like to do next? Translate one of the remaining simpler utilities like rfinfo.c?

Okay, let's translate the simple utility rfinfo.c. This script reads the header from the first file in a spectrogram sequence (e.g., prefix_000000.bin), extracts some basic parameters, counts how many sequential files exist, and prints a summary line.

We'll reuse the header parsing logic developed for rfio.py.

rfinfo.c -> rfinfo.py
Explanation and Notes:

Header Parsing: It reuses the _parse_header logic (using regular expressions) adapted from the rfio.py translation to extract frequency, bandwidth, and channel count from the first file's header.
File Prefix Handling: It tries to intelligently determine the base prefix, whether the user provides path/prefix or path/prefix_000000.bin.
File Counting: It starts from index 0 and checks for the existence of prefix_000000.bin, prefix_000001.bin, etc., using os.path.exists until a file in the sequence is missing.
Output: It prints a single line containing the prefix, frequency (MHz), bandwidth (MHz), channel count, and the total number of sequential files found, formatted similarly to the C version's output.
Command Line Argument: The C code directly uses argv[1]. This Python script uses sys.argv[1] directly for simplicity to mimic the C version's direct argument usage, bypassing argparse for the main argument (though argparse is set up for potential future expansion or standard help messages).
This script rfinfo.py provides the simple file sequence information utility.

The main pieces remaining are rfedit.c and rfpng.c, plus the interactive parts of rfplot.py/rffit.py. rfdop.c could also be translated as a standalone script wrapper around the logic already in rftrace.py. What would you like to do next?

Okay, let's translate rfdop.c. This script acts as a command-line tool to calculate detailed Doppler information (range, velocity, az/alt) for a specific satellite over a given time range and save it to a file.

The core calculation logic was already implemented as the compute_doppler function within the rftrace.py translation. This script will primarily parse command-line arguments and then call that function.

rfdop.c -> rfdop.py
Explanation and Notes:

Imports: Imports necessary libraries and functions from previously translated modules (rftime, rftles, rftrace).
Argument Parsing: Uses argparse to define and parse command-line arguments matching those in rfdop.c.
Site ID: Determines the site ID using the -s argument or the ST_COSPAR environment variable.
Start Time: Parses the start time provided either as MJD (-m) or a time string (-t) using nfd_to_mjd.
Time Steps: Generates an array of MJD times using numpy.arange based on the start time (mjd0), length (args.length), and time step (args.dt).
TLE Loading: Calls rftles.load_tles to load the TLE catalog.
Core Calculation: Calls the rftrace.compute_doppler function (which contains the main logic translated from rftrace.c) with all the parsed arguments and generated time steps. This function handles the propagation, calculations, and writing to the output file.
Simplicity: This script primarily acts as a command-line interface, setting up the parameters and delegating the actual work to the compute_doppler function in rftrace.py.
This completes the translation of rfdop.c into a functional Python script.

The remaining C files are rfedit.c, rfpng.c, and the test files. rfpng.c is likely redundant given rfplot.py, and test files are usually rewritten. rfedit.c is the only significant piece of C code left whose functionality hasn't been fully addressed. Would you like to translate rfedit.c next?

Okay, let's continue by translating the final C application file, rfedit.c.

This script appears to be a utility for reading a spectrogram dataset, potentially applying some basic transformations like frequency subsetting (-f, -w) or frequency offsetting (-o) during the read process via the arguments passed to read_spectrogram, and then immediately writing the result to a new output file prefix. It doesn't seem to perform complex editing operations on the data itself after reading.

rfedit.c -> rfedit.py
Explanation and Notes:

Functionality: This script acts as a command-line interface to read a spectrogram using rfio.read_spectrogram (which handles the frequency selection, offsetting, and binning based on arguments) and then immediately write the resulting Spectrogram object back out using rfio.write_spectrogram.
Dependencies: Relies only on the previously translated rfio.py module and argparse.
No Editing Logic: There's no explicit data modification logic within this script itself; any changes happen as part of the read process defined in rfio.py based on the command-line arguments passed to it.
Arguments: The command-line arguments directly mirror those in rfedit.c and control the parameters passed to read_spectrogram.
With this, we have translated all the primary C utility and application files (rffft, rfplot (static), rffit (core), rffind, rfinfo, rfdop, rfedit) along with their supporting modules (satutl, rftime, rfio, zscale, rfsites, rftles, rffft_internal).

The remaining C code consists of:

The SGP4/Deep/Optimization implementations (which we replaced with Python libraries).
rfpng.c (largely redundant functionality compared to rfplot.py).
The test suite (tests/).
The complex interactive components of rfplot.c and rffit.c.
Do you want to translate rfpng.c, or focus on potentially adding more functionality (like interactivity or fitting details) to the existing Python scripts?

Okay, let's translate rfpng.c. This script is designed to read spectrogram data and directly generate a PNG image file, including optional satellite trace overlays. It's essentially a non-interactive version of rfplot.c specifically for PNG output.

We will reuse much of the plotting logic developed for rfplot.py, including the helper functions for axes and trace plotting, using matplotlib as the plotting backend.

rfpng.c -> rfpng.py
Explanation and Notes:

Functionality: This script reads a spectrogram, computes satellite traces (optional), generates a plot using matplotlib, and saves it directly to a PNG file. It mirrors the non-interactive plotting functionality of rfplot.c.
Dependencies: Requires numpy, matplotlib, and the previously translated Python modules (rfio, rftime, rftrace, zscale, rftles, rfsites, and the plotting helpers from rfplot).
Non-Interactive Backend: matplotlib.use('Agg') is called at the beginning to ensure Matplotlib doesn't try to open an interactive window, suitable for scripts generating files.
Argument Parsing: Uses argparse with arguments largely matching rfpng.c and rfplot.c.
Plotting Logic: Reuses the core plotting logic from the rfplot.py translation:
Reads data via read_spectrogram.
Calculates traces via compute_trace.
Uses imshow to display the data.
Determines color limits via zscale_samples (from zscale.py).
Applies colormaps based on the -m argument.
Uses the same custom axis formatters (time_axis_formatter, freq_axis_formatter) and trace plotting (plot_traces) functions.
Output Filename: Implements the default filename generation based on timestamp and frequency if -o is not provided, similar to rfplot.c/rfpng.c.
Saving: Uses matplotlib.pyplot.savefig to save the plot directly to the specified PNG file. plt.close(fig) is important in scripts to free up memory after saving.
Peak Finding (-q): The C code rfpng.c calls a filter function, presumably for peak finding/plotting similar to the -q option mentioned in rfplot's usage. This Python version currently omits that specific functionality for simplicity, but the filter_data function (translated in rfplot.py and rffind.py) could be imported and called if desired.
This rfpng.py script provides the direct PNG generation capability. We have now translated all the main C application files (rffft, rfplot (static), rffit (core), rffind, rfinfo, rfdop, rfedit, rfpng) and their core dependencies.

The primary remaining work for a full Python equivalent would be implementing the interactive features of rfplot/rffit and potentially rewriting the C test suite in Python.



Okay, implementing the interactive features similar to those in the C versions of rfplot.c and rffit.c requires using Matplotlib's event handling system. The C code uses pgplot's pgband function to get keyboard and mouse input within the plot window; the Matplotlib equivalent involves connecting callback functions to specific events.

Here's a breakdown of how you would approach adding interactivity to the rfplot.py and rffit.py scripts we've developed:

1. Overall Structure:

Instead of a simple script that generates a plot and exits (or shows a static plot), you need an application structure. Often, this involves creating a class to manage the figure, axes, data, satellite traces, selected points, fitting parameters, and current interaction mode (e.g., selecting points, zooming).
The main part of the script would create an instance of this class, which would then set up the plot and connect event handlers. plt.show() would then start the interactive event loop.
2. Event Handling in Matplotlib:

Matplotlib allows you to connect functions (callbacks) to events like key presses, mouse button presses, mouse motion, etc.
You use fig.canvas.mpl_connect('event_name', callback_function).
The callback_function typically receives an event object containing information like the key pressed (event.key), mouse button (event.button), coordinates (event.xdata, event.ydata), and the axes the event occurred in (event.inaxes).
3. Implementing Specific Features (Examples):

Let's map some key interactive features from rfplot.c/rffit.c to Matplotlib event handling:

Point Selection ('s' key or mouse click):

C Code: Uses pgband to get cursor position and character 's' or 'A'.
Python/Matplotlib:
Connect to 'button_press_event'.
In the callback (on_click), check if event.inaxes is the main plot axes and event.button == 1 (left click).
Get coordinates event.xdata, event.ydata.
Convert these coordinates to the nearest data indices or store the raw coordinates.
Append the selected point/index to a list held by your application class (e.g., self.selected_points).
Update the plot: Draw markers for selected points (e.g., using ax.plot with stored points and a specific marker/color). Call fig.canvas.draw_idle() to refresh the display.
Reference: The contrib/satnogs_waterfall_tabulation_helper.py script provides a good example of handling mouse clicks to select points (on_mouse_press function).
Fitting ('f' key):

C Code: Detects 'f' key press, calls fitting routines (fit_trace or versafit/chisq).
Python/Matplotlib:
Connect to 'key_press_event'.
In the callback (on_keypress), check if event.key == 'f'.
Retrieve the list of currently selected points (self.selected_points).
Prepare the data for the fitting function (e.g., the fit_orbit function developed for rffit.py). Ensure the fitting function uses the selected points (this might require modifying fit_orbit or the chi_squared_doppler function to accept/use a subset of data based on flag == 2).
Call fit_orbit(self.fit_data).
Update the plot with the new fitted curve. Update any text displaying RMS or fitted parameters. Call fig.canvas.draw_idle().
Parameter Toggling ('1'-'8' keys):

C Code: Detects digit keys, toggles flags in the ia array.
Python/Matplotlib:
Connect to 'key_press_event'.
In on_keypress, check if event.key is a digit from '1' to '8'.
Update the corresponding boolean flag in your application state (e.g., self.fit_data.active_params list).
Optionally, update visual indicators on the plot (e.g., text labels showing active parameters). Call fig.canvas.draw_idle().
Zooming ('z' + box, '+', '-'):

C Code: Uses pgband mode 2 for box selection, or '+' / '-' keys.
Python/Matplotlib:
Matplotlib's interactive backends (like Qt, Tk, Wx) usually have built-in pan/zoom tools activated by toolbar buttons or key modifiers. This often makes manual implementation unnecessary for basic zooming.
For custom box zoom triggered by 'z': You could implement a state machine. Pressing 'z' sets the mode. Connect to 'button_press_event' to record the first corner, 'motion_notify_event' to draw a rubber band box, and 'button_release_event' to get the second corner and update axis limits (ax.set_xlim(xmin, xmax), ax.set_ylim(ymin, ymax)). Alternatively, Matplotlib's RectangleSelector widget can simplify this.
For '+' / '-' keys: Connect to 'key_press_event'. Get current axis limits (ax.get_xlim(), ax.get_ylim()). Calculate new limits based on the center point and a zoom factor (e.g., 1.5). Update limits using ax.set_xlim(), ax.set_ylim(). Call fig.canvas.draw_idle().
Deleting Points ('X'/'d' + box):

C Code: Uses pgband with 'X' or 'd' to trigger deletion logic (nearest point or points within a box).
Python/Matplotlib:
Connect to 'key_press_event'.
If event.key == 'x' (for nearest): Get event.xdata, event.ydata. Find the closest point in your data list (considering plot scaling). Mark the point's flag as 0 (ignored). Redraw the data points.
If event.key == 'd' (for box): Enter a box selection mode (similar to zoom box). Once the box is defined, iterate through data points, check if they fall within the box, and mark their flag as 0. Redraw.
Undo ('u'):

Requires maintaining a history of actions or deleted points. The callback for 'u' would revert the last change (e.g., restore the flag of the last deleted point, remove the last added selected point). Redraw.

Summary:

Implementing interactivity requires shifting from a simple script to an event-driven application structure, likely using a class.
Matplotlib's mpl_connect is used to link events (keys, mouse clicks) to Python callback functions.
Callbacks modify the application state (selected points, fit parameters) and update the plot using fig.canvas.draw_idle().
Features like point selection, fitting triggers, parameter toggles, and basic zoom/delete can be implemented within these callbacks.
Complex interactions like drag-and-drop box selection might benefit from Matplotlib's widget system (e.g., RectangleSelector).
It's a significant effort to replicate all the keyboard shortcuts and the exact behavior of pgband. You might prioritize the most important interactive features.
